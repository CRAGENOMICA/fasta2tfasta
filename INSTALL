Basic Installation
==================

To build and install fasta2tfasta, 'cd' to the directory containing the package's
source and type the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The './configure' command checks your build environment and allows various
optional functionality to be enabled (see Configuration below).  If you
don't want to select any optional functionality, you may wish to omit
configure and just type 'make; make install'.  However if the build fails you
should run './configure' as it can diagnose the common reasons for build 
failures.

The 'make' command builds fasta2tfasta.
If compilation fails you should run './configure' as it can diagnose
problems with your build environment that cause build failures.

The 'make install' command installs the fasta2tfasta executable to /usr/local.
The installation location can be changed by configuring with --prefix=DIR
or via 'make prefix=DIR install' (see Installation Locations below).

See README for recipes for typical installation.


System Requirements
===================

fasta2tfasta requires the boost library <http://www.boost.org>.
If you are unsure about this, be sure to use './configure' to determine
whether you have these libraries and to help diagnose which packages may
need to be installed on your build machine to provide them.


Configuration
=============

By default, './configure' examines your build environment, checking for
requirements such as the boost development files, and arranges for a plain
fasta2tfasta build.


The configure script also accepts the usual options and environment variables
for tuning installation locations and compilers: type './configure --help'
for details.  For example,

    ./configure CC=icc --prefix=/opt/icc-compiled

would specify that fasta2tfasta is to be built with icc and installed into bin,
lib, etc subdirectories under /opt/icc-compiled.


Installation Locations
======================

By default, 'make install' installs fasta2tfasta under /usr/local/bin and manual
pages under /usr/local/share/man.

You can specify a different location to install fasta2tfasta by configuring
with --prefix=DIR or specify locations.  Type './configure --help' for
the full list of such install directory options.

Alternatively you can specify different locations at install time by
typing 'make prefix=DIR install' or 'make bindir=DIR install' and so on.
Consult the list of prefix/exec_prefix/etc variables near the top of the
Makefile for the full list of such variables that can be overridden.

You can also specify a staging area by typing 'make DESTDIR=DIR install',
possibly in conjunction with other --prefix or prefix=DIR settings.
For example,

    make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging prefix=/opt

would install into bin and share/man subdirectories under /tmp/staging/opt.
