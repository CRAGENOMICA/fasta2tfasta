fasta2tfasta: File format conversor.


Building fasta2tfasta
=====================

The typical simple case of building fasta2tfasta is done as follows:

    cd .../fasta2tfasta    # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure
    make all

You may wish to copy the resulting fasta2tfasta executable into somewhere on your
$PATH, or run it where it is.

Rather than running-in-place like that, the next simplest typical case is to
install fasta2tfasta into a directory of your choosing. It, is done as follows:

    cd .../fasta2tfasta    # Within the unpacked release directory
    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/location
    make all

You will likely wish to add /path/to/location/bin to your $PATH.

See INSTALL for full building and installation instructions and details.
